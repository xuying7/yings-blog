# Week 4

SQL is short for “Structured Query Language”, but it is for more than just writing queries. It has two sub-parts:

- DDL (or “Data Definition Language”), used for defining schemas
- DML (or “Data Manipulation Language”), used for writing queries as well as for modifying the datase.

## Basic SELECT-FROM-WHERE queries

- Student(**sID**, surName, firstName, campus, email, cgpa)
- Course(**dept, cnum**, name, breadth)
- Offering(**oID**, dept, cNum, term, instructor)
- Took(**sID, oID**, grade)
- _and the foreign key relationships that you will recall_

```sql
csc343h-prof=> SELECT name             -- choose the column called "name"
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Course             -- from the Course table
    csc343h-prof-> WHERE dept = 'CSC';     -- choose only rows that satisfy
```

- `WHERE` is equivalent to σ in relational algebra.

## Compound conditions in a WHERE clause

We just saw our first compound condition. We can build boolean expressions using:

- logical operators: `=, <, >, <=, >=, !=` and `<>`. The operators `!=` and `<>` mean “not equals” in SQL.
- boolean operators: `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`

## Temporarily renaming a table

Similar to ρ in relational algebra, in SQL we can rename a table for the duration of a query. Here we rename `Employee` to `e` and `Deparment` to `d`:

```
    csc343h-prof=> SELECT e.name, d.name
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Employee e, Department d
    csc343h-prof-> WHERE d.name = 'marketing' and e.name = 'Horton';
```

## Naming columns

We can add an AS-expression to choose a column name in the result of a query.

```
    csc343h-prof=> SELECT name AS title, dept
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Course
    csc343h-prof-> WHERE breadth;
           title       | dept
    -------------------+------
     Intro Archaeology | ANT
     Narrative         | ENG
     Rhetoric          | ENG
     The Graphic Novel | ENG
     Mediaeval Society | HIS
     Black Freedom     | HIS
    (6 rows)
```

## Sorting

In relational algebra, a relation is a set and so order doesn’t matter. But in the real world, order often does matter. We can sort the results of a query by adding an `ORDER BY` clause to the end of a select-from-where query:

```sql
    csc343h-prof=> SELECT sid, grade
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Took
    csc343h-prof-> WHERE grade > 90
    csc343h-prof-> ORDER BY grade;
```

The default is to use ascending order, but we can override this by saying `DESC` (not `DESCENDING`):

```
    csc343h-prof=> SELECT sid, grade
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Took
    csc343h-prof-> WHERE grade > 90
    csc343h-prof-> ORDER BY grade DESC;
```

We can order according to multiple columns. Here, we see courses in order by `dept`, and where there are multiple rows with the same value for `dept`, they are further ordered by course `name`.

```
csc343h-prof=> SELECT *
csc343h-prof-> FROM Course
csc343h-prof-> ORDER BY dept, name;
```

## Expressions in a SELECT clause

Instead of a simple attribute name, you can use an expression in a SELECT clause. Here are two simple examples:

```
    csc343h-prof=> SELECT sid, grade + 10 AS adjusted
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Took;
      sid  | adjusted
    -------+----------
     99132 |       89
     99132 |      108
     99132 |       92
     99132 |      109
     ... etc.

    csc343h-prof=> SELECT dept || cnum
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Course
    csc343h-prof-> WHERE cnum < 200;
     ?column?
    ----------
     CSC148
     EEB150
     ENG110
     CSC100
    (4 rows)
```

- `||` is string concatenation.

## Expressions that are a constant

Rather than pull values from a table, a SELECT clause can use a constant value in a column. Here is an example:

```
    csc343h-prof=> SELECT name, 'satisfies' as breadthRequirement
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Course
    csc343h-prof-> WHERE breadth;
           name        | breadthrequirement
    -------------------+--------------------
     Intro Archaeology | satisfies
     Narrative         | satisfies
     Rhetoric          | satisfies
```

## Pattern matching

SQL provides the `LIKE` operator for comparing a string to a pattern. The pattern is a quoted string and can include these special characters:

- `_` matches any single character
- `%` matches any sequence of zero or more characters

Here are two simple examples:

```
csc343h-prof=> SELECT *
csc343h-prof-> FROM Course
csc343h-prof-> WHERE name LIKE '%to%';
 cnum |           name            | dept | breadth
------+---------------------------+------+---------
  343 | Intro to Databases        | CSC  | f
  148 | Intro to Comp Sci         | CSC  | f
```

`LIKE` offers an extremely limited form of pattern matching but has the advantage of being fast. SQL also supports regular expressions for string matching, using the `~` operator. For example:

```
csc343h-prof-> -- Find students whose surname begins with M or F or L, followed
csc343h-prof-> -- by 'a', and then zero or more additional characters.
csc343h-dianeh=> SELECT *
FROM Student
WHERE surname ~ '(M|F|L)a*';
```

## Computing on a column

SQL provides functions, such as `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max` and `count`, that can be used in a SELECT clause to apply to a column. We call this aggregation.

Here is an example showing the basics of aggregation.

```sql
    -- First we use aggregation to get the average of all the grades in the Took
    -- table.  Notice that the result has just one tuple, because there is
    -- just one average:
    csc343h-prof=> SELECT avg(grade)
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Took;
             avg
    ---------------------
     75.8545454545454545
    (1 row)

    -- Notice also that SQL invented a name for this column: the name of the
    -- aggregation function.  If we do some fancier calculation, it uses the
    -- column name "?column?":
    csc343h-prof=> SELECT max(grade) - min(grade)
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Took;
     ?column?
    ----------
          100

    -- Let's give that column a better name:
    csc343h-prof=> SELECT max(grade) - min(grade) AS range
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Took;
     range
    -------
       100
    (1 row)

    -- count(grade) counts the number of values in the grade column.
    csc343h-prof=> SELECT count(grade)
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Took;
     count
    -------
        55
    (1 row)

    -- If we give count a wildcard instead of a specific column name, we get
    -- the number of rows in the table.
    csc343h-prof=> SELECT count(*)
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Took;
     count
    -------
        55
    (1 row)
```

- `count(grade)` and `count(*)` give the same result here: there are as many values in the `grade` column as there are rows in the table. We will learn soon that SQL allows empty cells, and in that case, `count(grade)` – or counting any other column – and `count(*)` could report different values.

## Duplicates contribute

- use `DISTINCT`
- It does not affect `min` and `max`, but does affect `sum` and `avg`

Consider this:

```
    csc343h-prof=> SELECT sid, avg(grade)
    csc343h-prof-> FROM Took;
    ERROR:  column "Took.sid" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function
    LINE 1: SELECT sid, avg(grade) FROM Took;
                   ^
```

Here we are combining `sid` (of which there are many) with `avg(grade)` (of which there is one). That doesn’t produce a structurally sound table, which is why we get an error. The error message itself will make sense once we understand grouping.

Suppose table R contains this:

a | b
---+---
1 | 2
8 | 7
5 |
| 6

and table S contains this:

a | b
---+---
3 | 4
8 | 7
5 |
| 6

What is the output of this query?
a | b
---+---
8 | 7

# A2 Warm Up

```

Write SQL queries for each of the following:

1. Find all pairs of passengers such that they have the same last name and booked a seat in the same ﬂight within 1 hour of each other. Report their ﬁrstnames and lastname. Duplicates are ﬁne for this question as some passengers might have done it multiple times.

```sql
SELECT p1.last_name, p1.first_name, p2.first_name
FROM passenger p1, passenger p2, booking b1, booking b2
WHERE p1.last_name = p2.last_name
AND b1.passenger = p1.pid
AND b2.passenger = p2.pid
AND (b1.date_time - b2.date_time) <= INTERVAL '1 hour'
AND b1.passenger <> b2.passenger
AND b1.flight = b2.flight;


```

Passenger:

```text
pid | first_name | last_name  |               email
-----+------------+------------+-----------------------------------
   1 | Waneta     | Williams   | Waneta_Williams@yahoo.com
   2 | Craig      | Setzer     | Craig.Setzer@yahoo.ca
   3 | Richard    | Landry     | Richard.Landry@custom_domain.ca
   4 | Frankie    | Smallwood  | Frankie_Smallwood@gmail.com
```

Booking:

```sql
 bid | passenger | seat | flight | price |      date_time
-----+-----------+------+--------+-------+---------------------
   1 |        32 |  854 |      1 |   772 | 2022-07-16 10:00:00

   4 |        27 |   72 |      2 |  1261 | 2023-03-02 10:00:00
   5 |         6 |   14 |      2 |   817 | 2023-04-15 10:00:00
```

2.  Find the total number of operational airports per country. We deﬁne an airport to be operational if at least one ﬂight departs from or arrives at that airport. Only give countries which have at least two airports. Report the country name and the count.

```sql
SELECT city.country, count(airport) as Operational_airport
FROM airport, city
WHERE airport.city = city.cid
AND
EXISTS (
	SELECT * FROM route
	WHERE route.source = airport.code
	OR route.destination = airport.code
)
GROUP BY city.country
HAVING count(country)>=2;
```

```psql

3.  For each airline, get a count of the number of planes that are small, medium, and large. We’ll deﬁne a large plane as one that has all three seat classes and _at least_ 45 rows of seating, and a medium plane as one which is not large and that has at least two seat classes and a minimum of 30 rows of seating. All other planes that are not large or medium are considered small.

-- Warmup Query 3

-- You must not change the next 2 lines or the table or type definition.
SET SEARCH_PATH TO AirTravelWarmup;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS wu3 CASCADE;

DROP TYPE IF EXISTS size_type CASCADE;
CREATE TYPE AirTravelWarmup.size_type AS ENUM (
    'large', 'medium', 'small'
);

CREATE TABLE wu3 (
    airline_code CHAR(2),
    size size_type NOT NULL,
    num_planes int NOT NULL
);

-- Do this for each of the views that define your intermediate steps.
-- (But give them better names!) The IF EXISTS avoids generating an error
-- the first time this file is imported.
-- If you do not define any views, you can delete the lines about views.
-- DROP VIEW IF EXISTS intermediate_step CASCADE;

-- Define views for your intermediate steps here:
-- CREATE VIEW intermediate_step AS ... ;

-- Your query that answers the question goes below the "insert into" line:
INSERT INTO wu3
SELECT

	airline AS airline_code,
	plane_size AS size,
	COUNT(*) AS num_planes
FROM
	(SELECT plane.airline,
		CASE
			WHEN (count(DISTINCT seat.class) >= 3
			AND max(seat.row) >= 45)
			THEN 'large'
			WHEN (count(DISTINCT seat.class) >= 2
			AND max(seat.row) >= 30)
			THEN 'medium'
			ELSE 'small'
			END AS plane_size
	FROM seat, plane
	WHERE seat.plane = plane.tail_number
	GROUP BY plane.airline, plane.tail_number
	) plane_size

GROUP BY airline, plane_size;

As part of this query, you will need to take a look at the PostgreSQL documentation to learn about the command CAST. We have provided a type for you to use to represent the size of a plane.

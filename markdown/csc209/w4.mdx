## Strings

- We can use `char text[20]` to create a `String`
  - But! Inconvenient.
- `String` is still a `char array`
- So we need the end character `\0` to mean that is a C string.

```C
int main() {
	char text[20]:
	text[0] = 'a';
	...
	text[3] = '\0';

	printf("%s", text);
	printf("\n");
}
```

### Initialize String

-More Convenient way!

```C
int main() {
	char text[20] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o','\0' }

	//or,
	char text[20] = "hello";
	// you can change the variable
	// They are exactly same thing
	text[0] = 'j';

}
```

- So in the array, the rest elements, is all `\0

```C
char greet1[10] = "Hello";
// Where is the momery? global if that is decleared global/static if inside the function
char *greet2 = malloc(sizeof(char) * 10);
strncpy(greet2, greet1, 10);
// greet2 is on the stack
// memory allocated is on heap
const char *greet3 = "hello";
// string literal are stored in read only memory and modifying a string literal will result in an error, bus error or segmentation fault
```

### String Literal

- **String Literal** is the string that cannot be changed

```c
char *text = "hello"; // String Literal
```

- `text` points to the fist char of the string.

- That is a **constant**, causes **bus error**

### Common Mistake (about null terminator)

```c
char text[4];
text[0] = 'p';
text[1] = 'l';
text[2] = 'u';
text[3] = 'm';
printf("%s", text);
```

- Since the `printf` didn't read the null terminator, it will continue to print until encounter the null terminator.

### Methods/Properties

- On a array, `sizeof` always gives the number of bytes occupied by the array.
- **Compile-time** operation, it doesn't look at the contents of the array at all.

```c
char weekday [10] = "monday";
printf ("size of string: %lu\n", sizeof(weekday))
```

- `%lu` means unsigned long integer.

#### String length

- If we have two String and use `str1 + str2` to concatenate the string, it won't work

```c
#include <string.h>

char weekday [10] = "monday";
printf ("Length of string: %lu\n", strlen(weekday))
```

- `strlen` , not including the null terminating character.
- When it encounter the `\0`, mark the string end.
- So, in the next example, the output is 2.

```c
char text[10];
text[0] = 'a';
text[1] = 'b';
text[2] = '\0';
text[3] = 'c';
text[4] = 'd';
printf("%d\n", strlen(text));
```

#### Copying String

- When copy a string, we overwrite it was previously there; when we concatenate a string, we are adding to the end of what was previously there.

`char *strcpy(char *s1, const char *s2);`

- `strcpy` copy the characters from string s2 to the beginning of array s1. It will overwrite what is on the s1, but s1 isn't required to be a string when strcpy is called.
- But s2 is required to be a string when called. s2 can be _string literal_ or _char array_ includes a null terminator.

- **Unsafe** function. When the first s1 is smaller than the size of s2, some compiler may work, but will raise problem.

- Safe version - `strncpy`

`char *strncpy(char *s1, const char *s2, int n);`

- The new `n` parameter indicated the maximum number of characters that s1 can hold.
- It still has problem. It cant stop until find the first null termination char in s2. So null termination char in s1 is missed.

- if `char s1[5]`, we need to say that `s1[4] = '\0';`

- If we want to set the value of string,

```c
char delicious[30];
strcpy(delicious, "ice cream");
```

#### String concatenation

`char *strcat(char *s1, const char *s2);`

- Add the characters from s2 to the ending of string s1 (start of the first null terminator).
- Both s1 and s2 must be strings before calling strcat.
- It didn't write the null terminator.

- **UNSAFE**

`char *strncat(char *s1, const char *s2, int n);`

- Safe version. `int n` is the maximum char, not including the null terminator, that should be copied from s2 to the end of s1.
- Unlike the `strncpy`, strncat will always add a null terminator to s1.

```c
strncat(s1, s3, sizeof(s1) - strlen(s1) - 1)
```

- `-1` is to make room for the null terminator.

#### Searching String

##### Searching for a single char

`char *strchr(const char *s, int c);`

- First parameter is the string to search
- second parameter is the string to search for.
- It searches for the character from left to right.

- Return the pointer to the char was found, or `null`

```c
char s1[30] = ",,,";
char *p;
p = strchr(s1, 'v');

if (p == null) {...}
else {
	printf("character found at index %d\n", p - s1);
}
```

- In c, when we do two pointer difference, the result is the number of elements between the two pointers, not the difference in their raw memory addresi999s.

##### String Searching for String

`char *strstr(const char *s1, const char *s2);`

- searches from left to right in s1 for the first occurrence of the substring s2.
- if s2 is found in s1, `strstr` returns a pointer to the character of s1 that begins the match with s2.

## Structs

- Use to organize data when the type are not same.
- We need to use `dot notation` to access
- Things in the `structure` called `members`

### Example:

```c
struct student {
	char first_name[20];
	char last_name[20];
	int year;
	float gpa;
};
// struct already allocated the memory for the struct
struct student good_student;
// We cannot use student.name = "smth", it will point to the read-only memory
strcpy(good_student.first_name, "Jo");
strcpy(good_student.last_name, "smith");
good_student.year = 2;
good_student.gap = 3.2;
```

### Using Struct in Functions

- For an array, when we pass an array to the function, we pass the original one. So any change in the function will change the content of array.

```c
void change(int numbers[]) {
	numbers[0] = 80;
}
int main(void) {
	int my_array[5];
	my_array[0] = 40;
	change(my_array);
	// output is 80
}
```

- But for the `struct`, that is different. If we only pass the struct as the parameter to the function, everything will be a copy of the struct in the main function (including the array inside the struct). So, we need to pass the pointer to the parameter to change the original array.

```c
void change(struct student *s) {
	strcpy((*s).first_naem, "adam");
	(*s).gpa = 4.0;
}
int main (void) {
	change(&good_student);
}
// The output is expected.
```

#### `->` operation

```c
struct student s;
struct student *p;
..
p = &s;
(*p).gpa = 3.8;
p->year = 1;
strcpy(p->first_name, "hanrick");
```

- `p->first_name` is true a pointer.

- If we want pass the `char *name` to the `p->first_name`, we don't need dereference.

`strcpy(s->name, name);`

## Linked Struct.

### Difference with array

| Difference         | Array                          | Linked List/structure                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Implementation     | build into C language          | user-defined                                                      |
| Access and Storage | Use indices to fetch and store | requires "traverse" function to go over elements in the structure |
| size               | fixed size                     | dynamic size                                                      |

- `front` is a pointer hold the address of the first node in the list.
- Each node requires the `next` pointer to linked to the next node in the structure.
- Last node has nothing to point to, the value is null.

```c
typedef struct node {
    int value;              // Integer value
    struct node *next;      // Pointer to another node
} Node;
```

### Traverse.

- We need allocate the memory of the node in the heap by `malloc`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct node {
    int value;
    struct node *next;
} Node;

Node *create_node(int num, Node *next) {
    Node *new_node = malloc(sizeof(Node));
    new_node->value = num;
    new_node->next = next;
    return new_node;
}

int main() {

    Node *front = NULL;

    front = create_node(3, front);
    front = create_node(2, front);
    front = create_node(1, front);

    Node *curr = front;
    while (curr != NULL) {
        printf("%d\n", curr->value);
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

- First, use `typedef` to give a new name: Node.
- Then declare a node pointer called `*front` , the only `Node` variable is `front`.
- `curr` is not a pointer to pointer. It is a point as same as `front`. If that is a double pointer, it should define by `**curr`

### Insert

- Create a new node to be added
- Add the new node to the list by modifying the pointer to correct order.

```c
/* Insert a new node with the value num into this position of list front. */
void insert(int num, Node *front, int position) {
    Node *curr = front;
    for (int i = 0; i < position - 1; i++) {
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    printf("Currently at: %d\n", curr->value);

    Node *new_node = create_node(num, curr->next);
    curr->next = new_node;
}
```

#### Testing Insertion.

- With edge cases

```c
int insert(int num, Node **front_ptr, int position) {
    Node *curr = *front_ptr;

    if (position == 0) {
        *front_ptr = create_node(num, *front_ptr);
        return 0;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < position - 1 && curr != NULL; i++) {
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    if (curr == NULL) {
        return -1;
    }
    Node *new_node = create_node(num, curr->next);
    curr->next = new_node;

    return 0;
}
```
